## Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work on a well defined direction for your PWP. Based on the  Persona you've created it sounds like you have a good understanding of the target audience for your mom's yoga practice. You've done a really nice job of creating a Persona that reads like real person. Having access to information about your mom's current and prospective students will be a great asset for the upcoming design phase and content strategy. I look forward to seeing this project take shape.

Your project is set up according to spec, and your code looks good. Nice work. 

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
Although this project is very small in scope, some basic SEO considerations could help your mom's search engine results. Google has a decent starter guide here:

A couple of other very simple things I would include at a minimum are a &lt;meta&gt; description tag, and SEO-aware file names and `alt` text for all images.

A very minor point here, but going forward I recommend not relying so much on the &lt;br&gt; tag for visual spacing of content. That's better done using CSS.
