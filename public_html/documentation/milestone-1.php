		 <h2>Persona</h2>
		 <p><em>Name:</em> Lisa Vorhees<br>
			 <em>Age:</em> 53
			 <br>
			 <em>Profession:</em> Lisa works for Los Alamos High School. She is a biology teacher and mother of 2.
			 <br>
			 <em>Technology:</em>  At work she uses a Dell Desktop running Windows 10. At home she uses a Macbook Pro and an iPhone 7. She does most of her web searches on her work computer or phone.
			 <br>
			 <em>Attitudes and Behaviors: </em> Lisa is a busy women! She has to balance her career as a teacher with taking care of her two children. Lisa used to be very physically active, but over the years has had less time to excercise. A recent back injury has motivated her to focus more on her health.
			 <br>
			 <em>Frustrations and Needs:</em> Lisa has been frustrated with the other yoga classes she has found in her community. The other classes she has been to have been too big, and she worried that she was not doing the positions in a safe way for her recovering back. She would like to have more personal attention in the class to make sure that she is using correct technique. Additionally, there is a lack of quality web resources to find out about options in her area. She is busy and only has chances to do quick searches on the web.
			 <br>
			 <em>Goals: </em> Lisa would like to find a yoga teacher to give her private classes to help her continue to learn as a yogi in a way that is safe for her lower back.
			 <br>
			 <em>User Story: </em> As a user, Lisa needs to see Sarah's site, quickly gauge if Sarah is a teacher that Lisa would like to take classes from, and have a way of contacting Sarah.
