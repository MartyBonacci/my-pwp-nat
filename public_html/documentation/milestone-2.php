	 <h1>Milestone 2: Sarah Gustafson's Yoga Page</h1>
	 <section class="purpose">
		 <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		 <p> My site will be one page and will consist of the following sections:</p>
		 <p><b>Welcome:</b> A brief one-line introduction that clearly states Sarah Gustafson and Yoga Instructor. This site will be showcasing my photography skills as well so this will be a high quality image. On the mobile view this photo will take up the whole screen (possibly it will be a different photo that is not a wide landscape). There will be an menu icon that will drop down upon selection. On the full-screen layout the photo will be front and center with a navigation bar menu above.
			<br>
		 <p></p><b>About Sarah:</b> This section will detail her professional yoga history and a bit of her personal backstory. This will create and emotional connection with the viewer. The text will be broken up by Sarah's headshot. </p>
		 <div>
		 	<p><b>Private Classes:</b> The private classes section will contain a few lines of text about the benefits of private classes and other pertinent info.</p>
		 </div>
		 <div>
		 	<p><b>Photo Gallery:</b> Between the two class sections there will be a thumbnail with either 3 or 4 pictures that expand. The pictures will be from each class type (private, group, and family yoga). They will expand upon selection.
		 </div>
		 <div>
			 <p><b>Group Classes and Schedule:</b> The group classes will be explained within the schedule. Each class will have a brief description with the time and date of the classes</p>
		 </div>
		 <p><b>Contact:</b> This section will contain a simple contact form with a message box to send a3 message directly on the site.
